We attract highly motivated individuals who aspire to secure positions at top universities worldwide. The program is ideal for those who thrive on challenges, are eager to explore new subjects, and enjoy exchanging ideas with world-class researchers and academics. While there are no strict English language requirements, we recommend choosing English as one of the modules if proficiency needs improvement.
