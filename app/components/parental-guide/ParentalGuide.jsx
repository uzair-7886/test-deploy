          We understand that sending your child away for a summer course to Oxford is an important decision, and it’s a responsibility we take very seriously. This guide provides additional information to address any concerns parents may have about the welfare of their children. We are also happy to discuss any specific questions regarding accommodation or other aspects of the program.          </p>

            WHY ATTEND OUR SUMMER PROGRAMS
          </h2>
          <p className="text-textColor leading-relaxed text-justify font-roboto">
          With years of experience running summer courses, we have seen young students start the program with initial nerves but leave with some of the most enriching and memorable experiences of their lives. Their time in Oxford, exploring its charming alleys and historic colleges, learning fascinating new topics, and connecting with peers from around the world, introduces them to a new sense of wonder and inspires them to pursue higher levels of knowledge and education. Students interact with some of Oxford’s brightest faculty and seize the rare opportunity to experience life at one of the world’s oldest centres of learning. No student has ever left our program unhappy with their decision to attend.          </p>
