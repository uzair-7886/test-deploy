          All students are required to remain on the premises from 9 pm onwards, with curfew starting at 10:30 pm, when all summer program students are expected to return to their dorms. Our staff ensures that everyone is safely checked in before the set curfew time. Within the premises, students are free to use the common rooms, watch television, and socialise in a relaxed and secure environment. For added safety, staff members are on-site and available throughout the night should any student require assistance.
